# Status

## 2026-09-27: rebuilt from scratch for T2

The previous project (a staged, documentation-heavy Debian design without T2 support)
was removed from `main`. Its history remains in git. It was replaced by one guided
installer built around the MacBook Air's T2 chip.

### Contents

- `install.sh` + `installer/`: 14 resumable steps (preflight, network, base, t2, host,
  reboot, wifi, tailscale, firewall, docker, supabase, admin, public, finish).
- `macserver`: status, keys, logs, restart, update, backup, public on/off/setup, wifi, doctor.
- `host/`: firewall, Docker daemon, APT sources and pins, GRUB T2 options, logind,
  journald, sysctl, battery limit unit.
- `admin/`: root status collector plus a read-only admin page behind `tailscale serve`.
- `gateway/`: Caddy path filter plus cloudflared (pinned by digest).
- Pins: Supabase `self-hosted/v0.8.2` = `47111f95…`; APT key fingerprints for
  t2linux, Docker and Tailscale; Caddy 2.11.4, cloudflared 2026.9.3.

### Verified

- On the Windows development PC: `bash -n` on all scripts, ShellCheck 0.11 (clean),
  `tests/test_lib.sh` (with Windows-only mode changes stubbed), and 22 Python tests
  (admin authorization and live HTTP, collector parsing, repository invariants).
- Upstream facts checked on 2026-09-27: t2linux trixie repo layout and packages
  (`linux-t2-lts`, `apple-firmware-script`, `t2fanrd`), `get-apple-firmware`
  subcommands, Supabase v0.8.2 compose (`name: supabase`, `api-gw` Envoy on 8000,
  `supabase-db`), and key fingerprints.

### Not verified yet (needs the real Mac and CI)

- The whole install on the MacBook Air: T2 kernel boot, the T2 keyboard driver in the initramfs,
  Wi-Fi firmware download, the battery threshold file, t2fanrd.
- `tests/gateway_test.sh` (needs Docker; runs in CI) and Compose validation.
- `pg_dumpall` as `supabase_admin` over TCP inside `supabase-db`.
- `tailscale serve` HTTPS on the user's tailnet.

### Next

Run the installer on the Mac, then record what was confirmed or corrected here.
